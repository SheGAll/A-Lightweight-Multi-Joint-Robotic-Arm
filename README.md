# A-Lightweight-Multi-Joint-Robotic-Arm
•	Developed two types (4-axis and 6-axis) of lightweight robotic arms and achieved motion control.

•	Built a control system based on RS485 and servo, realizing trajectory planning based on quintuple polynomials. 

•	Implemented the digital twin of the robotic arm in the PC using QT-based software.

•	Complete writing, teaching and other functions
